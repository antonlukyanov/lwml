- `imgproc` stuff related to image processing
- `io` file based input-output
- `libs` additional libraries on which lwml depends
- `lua` lua-based config, utilities for lua integration
- `m_alg` advanced mathematical algorithms
- `m_alg_spec` advanced maths
- `m_base` base maths
- `m_import` parts of third-party libraries
- `m_types` data structures for maths
- `memory` memory-related stuff
- `psgraph` PostScript graphics support
- `random` random number generators
- `system` system-dependent classes
- `threads` wrapper classes for pthread library
